# misc_thesis_codes
One-off codes from my thesis research, mostly written in Python.

This repo contains some codes used during my MSc thesis. The MCMC model contained in run_sampling_interp_idw.py
ended up not being used in my final thesis, but it is a brief example of how to set up inverse distance weighting interpolation
and some python coding. 

**Note: these codes have some 3rd party dependencies (Stan, ArcGIS, etc.) and therefore may not be executable.
